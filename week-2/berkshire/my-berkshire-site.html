<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Translating our previous learning with HTML into an actual site was fun and straightword. Using our previous knowledge of HTML it was very easy to recreate the Berkshire website.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It wasn't too bad researching and finding out the elements we needed to use for HTML5. One of the commands that we did use was [alt] for the Geico img. We also added <header>,<section> and <footer> tags to differentiate the different areas of our page.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
It was no problem fo us to use best practices and keep from formatting in our HTML.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Our knowledge of HTML is so limited at this point that it's difficult to say what might be good or bad about it. One good thing about HTML is that you can instantly preview your work and you will know immediately whether or not you have made a mistake.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
We have memorized the few HTML tags that have been needed so far. No tricks have been used but we did take advantage of sublime's autofill to complete our tags. We simply don't have enough experience with HTML so no tricks have developed yet.
