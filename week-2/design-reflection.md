# My new site map

![Lars Site Map v1](/imgs/site-map.png)


# What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

1. Information Gathering : Identify the website's purpose, goal(s), target audience and core content (information, product/service, e-commerce, etc.)
2. Planning : Develop a site map with topics and sub-topics.
3. Design : Determine the site's look & feel while keeping the target audience in mind. Develop and provide prototype design(s).
4. Development : Create the home page and a shell for interior pages, refine these and enable key elements such as Content Management System (CMS), forms, carts, etc.
5. Testing and Delivery : Test things like navigation, complete functionality of forms, scripts, compatability/responsiveness, etc. Install any plugins (wordpress/CMS, SEO) the use FTP and upload to the server(s).
6.Maintenance : This is the iterative process of developing, testing and deploying new functionality or content updates. A CMS can be leveraged to enable the site owner(s) to perform some of their own content updates.


# What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of my site is to serve as a starting point for anyone that may be interested in me, my blog or my projects. Although the site should ultimately be professional enough to interest prospective employers, I will try not make it too dry or stodgy. The initial content of my site will include; my photo and a brief biography, my contact information, my reflections and blog postings from DBC, and information on the projects that I'm involved in.


# What are your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience includes fellow bootcampers, friends, colleagues, potential collaborators, and ultimately prospective employers. Hopefully, they will be interested in finding or contacting me to connect on social networks, read my blog, collaborate on different projects, and/or hire me. My site will address these interests by including my contact and background information along with blog posts and information on my projects.


# What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

My user's primary "action" will depend on who they are. Friends, colleagues and fellow bootcampers may look at my site to learn more about me, consider the material, provide feedback, and/or engage with me on different topics. Prospective collaborators and employers will be most interested in my bio and seeing the different projects that I'm involved in.


# What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design and user experience (UX) are critical to the success of any website or web application. Together they directly impact a site's usability, utility, accessibility, compatability, performance, and subjective experience.


# What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

UX design varies by situation, and it's difficult to measure. It's also not the same as usability design. While usability designers are focused on user-friendliness and UI efficiency, UX designers are much more concerned with how a user "feels" about the experience they are having.


# Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I did not find this challenge tedious. However, these exercises will be much more interesting when we are able to apply them to more complex and compelling requirements.
