# Reflections on Solo Challenge 2.8 - Your Website, part 2

## How was your experience translating a wireframe into HTML?

I enjoyed the experience of translating my wireframes into HTML. However, I ended up revising them a few times before doing so. My original design included a search box and a drop down navigation panel, I thought it looked nice, but I realized the search box was unneccesary and the navigation panel would have been confusing to people unfamiliar with a [hamburger icon](http://blog.placeit.net/history-of-the-hamburger-icon/). These changes took some time, but they resulted in a user friendly design that was ultimately easy to translate into HTML.


## What new tricks or elements did you learn about in HTML?

All of the HTML elements that were new to me this week are excluded from use in this exercise because they either are not valid HTML5 or there are better ways to do the same thing using CSS (i.e., no tables, text styling, backgrounds, etc.).


## Are you excited to start incorporating the design you chose next week?

I am *really* looking forward to start incorporating the design I selected next week. In particular, I'm looking forward to adding a large background image (if I can figure out how to make it scale for different screen sizes) and laying out the two main sections of my [wireframe](imgs/wireframe-index.png).
