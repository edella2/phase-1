            <h4>Git is a Version Control System</h4>
            <p>Now that you're familiar with version control, let's be a little more specific and talk about git, one of the most popular VCS products in use today. Git was originally developed by Linus Torvalds and we'll be using it to keep track of changes we make on projects at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>Git helps us manage our changes by running locally on our individual computers. We tell it the branch (feature) we're working on, what to track (add), and when to take each snapshot of our changes (commit). We also include comments with these snapshot so our history and progress are easy to navigate. All of this is maintained for each project in an invisible directory on our hard drives called a repository (repo).

            <h4>We share and collaborate on GitHub</h4>
            <p>While git can be run on its own, we also use the valuable Internet service GitHub to share and collaborate on our git repositories. We use GitHub to maintain copies of each repo including all of our snapshots (commits), branches and comments. This is helpful for several reasons. First, by maintaining a remote copy of our repos we are guarding against their potential loss in the event that our own copies fail for any reason. Second, we are making the content of our repos and the branches we develop available for evaluation/comment and collaborative (or derivative) work. Finally, I expect to learn a great deal (and hope eventually contribute something meaningful) through my participation in the worldwide developer community on GitHub.</p>

            <h3>GPS1.2 Reflections</h3>
            <h4>1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?</h4>
            <p>In this challenge, we used the declarative tag !DOCTYPE. We also used the html, head and body tags. Although we did not use all of them, we discussed some of the main semantic tags that go inside the body of a typical HTML5 document. For example; header, main, article, section, nav, aside and footer. I'm sure we'll be returning to all of these tags frequently. The first few are required for HTML5 validation and the others are optional but their proper use is key to good document structure and html legibility.</p>
            <h4>How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?</h4>
            <p>Elements are laid out logically and displayed in sequence according to their tags. The title is displayed in either the browser window or browser's tab. Next up is the main body content: header, (navigation, sections/articles/asides) and finally the footer.
            <h4>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?</h4>
            <p>I love learning everything I can about Sublime and I have really been enjoying my research with the Tuts+ video series, <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-2">Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text 2</a>. It was easy to create the html snippet for this challenge and I am sure that I'll be researching and creating even more shortcuts as I gain familiarity with the software.</p>
