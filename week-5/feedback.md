# Pairing

###1. What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?

I have really enjoyed all of my pairing sessions.

###2. What aspects of pairing were particularly fun or rewarding?

I love getting to know and solving problems with other copperheads. Putting our heads together and working as a team on these challenges has been great fun!

###3. What aspects of pairing were frustrating and difficult?

In one pairing session, I was a little tired and unable to offer as much to the session as I would have liked. Another time, my partner would occasionally begin typing into CoderPad while I was driving. That broke my concentration and was less than ideal, but I know it was a mistake so it was no big deal.

# Feedback

###1. How did you feel when you read your feedback?

I like reading my feedback because it’s great hearing how others feel about my contributions and the areas I should work on after each pairing session. I am also very appreciative of any feedback at all because I don’t think writing feedback is something that comes naturally for most people.

###2. Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?

I believe the feedback I’ve gotten so far has been helpful to my learning in that each time something is pointed out as an area for improvement, I have done my best to work on that in the following sessions.

###3. Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?

Based on the feedback I have received so far, I’ll continue working on the following each time I pair (not in order):

* mention how I learn best
* read each assignment in advance
* work on my method syntax and logic
* stay focused to keep the conversation more work related
* spend more time discussing each challenge and breaking it down into pseudocode

###4. How was it to write feedback? What can you do to improve your own feedback?

As a former manager, writing feedback feels a lot like writing performance reviews. I’ve always enjoyed the opportunity to reinforce something positive and share where there may be areas for improvement. However, in these pairing sessions, I’ve had a hard time writing feedback because it’s been difficult to always come up with an area of improvement and I believe that’s part of the expectation. I am trying to be more attentive to the dynamics of each session (vs. just the challenges) so I can do a better job of noticing and commenting on areas of improvement.

###5. What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?

It has been difficult for me to think of things that my pairing partners should work on because I’ve been fortunate to have had great experiences in each session. Apart from both of us needing to spend more time on pseudocoding, I have struggled to think of things that I would naturally ask my partners to to change. Given these great experiences, it has sometimes felt a bit contrived to come up with an area for my partner to work on.

###6. Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?

I have really enjoyed the pairing sessions and found both the objective and subjective feedback helpful in guiding my learning process. I don’t know if anyone else feels this way, but I think perhaps there should be less emphasis on always coming up with an area for improvement when writing feedback.
