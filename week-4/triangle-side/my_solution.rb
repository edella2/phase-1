# I worked on this challenge with: Gabrielle Gustilo


# Your Solution Below

# Write a method valid_triangle? which takes as its input three non-negative numbers. It should return true if the three numbers could form the side lengths of a triangle and false otherwise.

# equilateral (all sides same)
# Pythagorean/right angle (two sides greater than third)
# isosceles (two sides the same)
# valid triangle (no zero side)

def valid_triangle?(a, b, c)

  if (a + b > c) && (a + c > b) && (b + c > a)
    return true
  else
    return false
  end

end

p valid_triangle?(3,4,5)


# The arguments don't correspond to specific sides. Don't worry about handling negative inputs â€” garbage in gets garbage out.

# Note: When you see a method that has a ? in its name, that means the expected result is a boolean value. It should return true or false. Keep this in mind when working through later challenges or writing your own challenges.

# For example,

# valid_triangle?(0,0,0) # => false, because a triangle can't have 0-length sides

# valid_triangle?(1,1,1) # => true, an equilateral triangle

# valid_triangle?(3,4,5) # => true, a right triangle
# valid_triangle?(4,3,5) # => true, the same right triangle
# valid_triangle?(5,3,4) # => true, the same right triangle

# valid_triangle?(10, 10, 100) #=> false, no such triangle exists
