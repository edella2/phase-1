# Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a new GitHub repository in DBC we go to a website (https://github.com/new) and fill out a very simple form. This form allows you to enter the name of your new repository and provide a brief description. Next you select whether you want the new repository to be public (viewable by anyone, but you determine who will contribute) or private (you determine who can view and/or contribute).

After this, you can elect to include a README file (a brief explanation of your repository), and optionally add a license which will dictate the use and distribution of your content. In DBC, we have been selecting the MIT License which is the most liberal of the open source licenses. You can safely skip the .gitignore option (by leaving it set to None) and click on the green button labeled “Create repository.”

Now that your repository has been created, you should make a copy of it on your computer. We call this cloning, and it’s easy to do. First, go to the home page of your new repository. You will find this at https://github.com/USERID/REPONAME (replace USERID with your own user ID and replace REPONAME with the name of your new repository). Next look on the right hand side of that page for something that says HTTPS clone URL. You want to copy this URL (clicking on the icon to its right will copy it to your clipboard). Finally, you will want to open the Terminal application on your Mac, type the following command and paste in the URL that you copied before pressing enter (return).

  git clone [paste copied URL here and press enter/return]
  [if you are prompted for your GitHub userid/password, it’s ok to provide them here].


# Describe what open source means.

Software can be distributed in a few different ways. With commercial licenses, the human readable programming (source code) is usually protected both technically and legally from modification and/or reverse engineering. At the other end of the spectrum, there are no restrictions whatsoever on what can be done with software in the public domain. It doesn’t even have to be attributed to its developer or owner.

Software that gets released as open source, on the other hand, falls somewhere in between the two extremes of commercial and public domain. By definition, open source software allows other people to see and modify the underlying code, but there can still be terms and conditions which stipulate exactly how the product can be used, modified and distributed. This can lead to breakthroughs and improvements that were never conceived of by the original developers. Even so, most open source licenses also ensure that the original developers are recognized while making it easy for other developers to access, contribute and distribute their own related work and ideas. Some open source licenses even allow 3rd parties to sell their own versions and distributions of the product - all while maintaining the clear ownership, copyright and/or patents of the owner.



# What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I am very much in favor of open source software and it does not make me feel nervous or protective. On the contrary, I feel that open source should be the preferred method of distribution because it offers the greatest potential for breakthrough advances – as we have seen in some the world’s most important software products (Linux, Apache, Java, Git, etc.). Having said that, I also believe that open source licensing depends largely on the integrity of those using, changing and distributing the product. In this way, I also recognize that in certain contexts, open source may seem a bit utopian.


# Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are a legal instrument for declaring the development and ownership rights (copyright and/or patent holders) associated with a particular software product. These licenses also clarify the legal boundaries and permissions under which that product can be used, modified and distributed. Open source licenses in particular can be used to ensure proper attribution and some protection for the owner while still encouraging the free and easy sharing of related ideas and contributions.


# What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I appreciate the opportunity for additional practice in creating a repo on GitHub, cloning that on my Mac, creating a new branch on my Mac and populating it with some content, then staging and committing that content before pushing it back up to GitHub. I also benefited from the additional practice on GitHub in creating a pull request, merging my content back in to the master branch, deleting the feature branch, and finally on my Mac, pulling the updated master branch back down to my local repository. While I wouldn’t say that I had an ‘aha’ moment or struggled with anything in particular, I’m confident this extra practice has helped me solidify the core concepts and that the more I continue to practice the more comfortable I will become in executing them. I also enjoyed and was very impressed with many of the capabilities and shortcuts outlined in Jeffery Way’s, Perfect Sublime Workflow course (I'm still only halfway through it but will definitely finish).
