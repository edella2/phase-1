#1.1 Think About Time

This challenge exposed me to several time management and productivity ideas but I decided to focus in on our ability to cultivate a growth mindset and good habits through small repeated wins. This is consistent with the Fogg method for creating successful habits by putting behavior above attitude, finding an existing trigger and repeating a very small behavior that can be expanded upon over time. I found it helpful to learn that some people have both a fixed and growth mindset, and that their proportion of growth mindset can be increased with persistence and repeated success.

Timeboxing is the act of working for a prescribed amount of time and then stopping to evaluate accomplishments whether or not the work is complete. I will be timeboxing in Phase 0 to stay on schedule, sharpen my focus and hopefully learn more. As a perfectionist, I expect this to be a challenge – at least initially.

I currently manage my time with lists of action items and due dates that I review daily and check off as tasks are completed. This approach has generally worked well for me, but I tend to get bogged down and spend more time than necessary on individual tasks (to the point of diminishing returns). In order to accommodate the pace and scope of Phase 0, I will be expanding my current process.

My new time management plan for Phase 0 will still lean heavily on to-do lists and due dates, but I will also be scanning each challenge for borders before jumping in, estimating the time that I plan on spending, timeboxing certain tasks, and taking breaks to help keep me focused and on track. I have never tried meditation before, but I am also looking forward to trying the mindful meditation app, Headspace, during some breaks to manage stress while improving focus, memory and creativity.

#1.2 The Command Line

A Unix shell is a both a command line interpreter and a programming language that enables the most efficient access to the inner workings of a computer. Shells can be used interactively by giving them commands, options and arguments from the keyboard, or they can run commands from a file (like .bash_profile or test.rb). There is more than one type of shell and different people generally prefer one shell over the others. In Dev Bootcamp, we’re using the bash shell which is the default on Mac OS (and some other operating systems). Just like other shells, bash includes modifiable commands along with modifiable elements of the user interface and operation.

For me, the most challenging part of this exercise was (and will continue to be) trying to memorize a large number of commands and some of the options that go with them. For example, I will definitely need more practice to really get familiar with find, grep, and xargs.

I was able to use all of the commands successfully, but for some reason (that I’ve not yet had time to pursue) the command “apropos” seems to be returning mostly illegible text.

I believe man is the most important command because its manual pages are the key to unlocking everything else. Having said that, I also believe ls, find, grep and xargs are very important because they can be used to find various combinations of files plus very specific content within those files.

Command Line Definitions

  pwd – stands for print working directory. It displays the path of your current directory.

  ls – lists the contents of your current directory. It can be used with options (like –a or -l) to display hidden files, show permissions, ownership, file size, and more.

  mv – is used to move or rename files.

  cd – is used to change your current working directory.

  ../ – is used in conjunction with other commands to go up one level in the filesystem.

  touch – creates a new empty file or files. It also changes the timestamp on an existing file.

  mkdir – makes a new directory or directories.

  less – invokes a pager program that makes it easy to view files one page at a time.

  rmdir – removes an empty directory or directories.

  rm – removes a file or files. When used with the –rf option, it will remove a directory and its contents.

  help – displays manual pages (windows variant of man).
